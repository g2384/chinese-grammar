# 却

= however. <!--is used in a similar way to 倒()-->

Note: 却 is not a conjunction. It's an adverb. So it needs to come *after the subject* and *before the verb*.

|| sentence, subject + 却……
|| sentence, 但是 + subject + 却……
|| sentence, 然而 + subject + 却……
|| sentence, 而 + subject + 却……
|| sentence, 可 + subject + 却……
|| sentence, 可是 + subject + 却……

The first clause above makes a statement, and then the second clause introduces something contrary, generally in the form of a *negative* comment, e.g. disappointment, criticism, disgreement or unexpectedness.

> 我是你最好的朋友，你**却**没邀请我。  
= 我是你最好的朋友，**但是**你**却**没邀请我。  
I'm your best friend, but you didn't invite me.

> 他是老板，**却**没有人听他的。(Two clauses have the same subject, so the second subject can be omitted)  
= 他是老板，**可是却**没有人听他的。  
He's the boss, but nobody would listen to him.

> 这件衣服虽然是名牌，质量**却**不怎么样。  
= 这件衣服虽然是名牌，**而**质量**却**不怎么样。  
Although this dress is a famous brand, its quality is not very good.
